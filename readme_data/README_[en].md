# Django Blog Web
[[switch to czech]](../README.md)

The purpose of this project was to learn the structure of Django, its capabilities, 
to find the optimal approach to solving programming challenges, and to adopt workflows.


## Project Description

The project itself focuses on pages for creating and managing media articles. 
The project is based on this template: https://bootstrapious.com/p/bootstrap-blog and its backbone is:

- Pages for displaying and searching published articles
- Pages for user (and author) login and management
- Pages for creating, editing, and deleting articles
- Homepage with editable content for superusers

This is my third project (second in Django), which is intended to advance me on my way to becoming a programmer.

## My Journey

I started learning Python more than two years ago and successfully completed a 3-month course about a year ago, 
which gave me an introductory overview of using Python for web application programming.

After the course, I spent a few months gaining experience on an application written in Flask. 
It was a very simplified version of this project. 
I hoped that after completing it, I would be ready for the job market. 
However, it was still not enough for work from home, with the prospect of which I am learning all this, 
and I realized that Flask is not enough and that I need to have a good understanding of Django as well.

I started by rewriting the project in Django as well to understand what connects them. 
Then I received a test task to assess my abilities. At first I perceived the task as easy, 
as its assignment was not much different from what I had already done. 
But over time I realized that there is still a lot that I don't know 
and that I need to know in order to be able to apply for such a job. 
I turned the test task into teaching material.


## Learning Process

Where possible, I tried to take a different approach than in my previous project in order to learn as much as possible. 
I also adapted the pace to this and the priority was to understand everything so that I fully understood it. 
This slowed everything down extremely and the project, 
which I originally thought I would have for a month, became an almost half-year affair.

Only time will tell if it was a well-invested time. 
But my personal progress is already evident in the fact that I fully understand everything in my code 
and I am also able to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen approaches. 
And so I hope that I have fulfilled the main priority of the entire project, 
to understand and master Django well so that I can confidently look for work in this field.

## Role of ChatGPT

The free version of ChatGPT, which despite its few-year-old database still kept up 
with what I needed from it, became an invaluable helper to me. 
It can be said that almost everything I needed to know I learned from it. 
Gradually, I also learned how to specify my queries well so that I get very relevant answers. 
ChatGPT has become my assistant, with its help I know that I have nothing to fear from any challenge. 
Having such a sophisticated statistical tool at hand is a real joy for a programmer, 
especially when you can talk to it in normal language.

## Workflows

All my workflows have settled on breaking down the most common approaches 
to a given thing with a description of the advantages and disadvantages. 
Even diagnosing errors and finding remedies has been simplified incredibly. 
I practically never came across anything that I came up with and then could not be done. 
But paradoxically, it also slowed me down a bit, 
because I canceled a lot of things that I did because they were unnecessary. 
But I learned from all of that. 
And whenever a situation arose when everything was boiling in my head, 
I went for a walk with the dog, and I came home with a solution already thought out.

## Conclusion

The project itself is not fully completed, and if no one asks me to, it will probably never be fully completed.
However, it has fulfilled everything I expected from it, and given my current financial situation, 
it doesn't make much sense to spend time on things I already know well.
I would rather continue to develop on projects for which I will also be financially rewarded.

From this perspective, you could say that the project is completely finished, 
as its task was to get me to a level where I can confidently start looking for a job in this field 
and gradually develop and grow further.

If these lines are being read by a potential employer for whom the code in this project is primarily intended, 
I hope that they will look past what I don't know yet and focus on how I deal with what I already know.
I tried to go the modular route as much as possible, but at the same time avoid too much fragmentation.
The descriptions may be more extensive for some, but I took it that it is easier to delete them than to write them.

I didn't have time for unit tests at all. I may get to them if no one is interested in me professionally.
But I don't think they will be more demanding than anything I have encountered so far, 
so I believe they are not so much about ability as about time.

So overall, I'm ready. And if you're looking for someone you can rely on to always do a good job, I'm here for you.
I enjoy programming, it's in my blood and I take my work as my calling card.
There's still a lot I'll need to learn, but I have the basics and they're good.
Most importantly, I have the desire to continue developing and I look forward to new challenges and skills.
